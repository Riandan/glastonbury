          All tickets have now been dispatched and delivered to all successful
          applicants. Please note, having a ticket does NOT grant you access to
          the festival. As stated on the Event Details page, you will enter a
          series of queue checkpoints before you can enter the venue â€“ failure
          to complete a checkpoint, failure to enter. The ticket you have
          received in the post MUST be brought with you on the day of the event.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white my-2">
          The ticket in your bundle must be brought to the event on the day.

        <p className="text-white my-2">
          Once you have successfully entered the festival, your ticket will
          grant you access to a lovely outdoor toilet, seating areas and a bar.
          Drinks can be purchased on sight, however our prices have increased
          since last year due to inflation (i.e. recuperating back spends on
          this year's event). A SMALL selection of food will be available on the
          day, but please feel free to bring your own dishes to share amongst
          others if you feel so inclined.
