          adults with existing tickets must still arrive between 4pm - 4.10pm
          with their ticket in hand. Please coordinate amongst yourselves to
          ensure you ALL arrive within this time frame, as you will all be
          entering as a collective group. This means no adult(s) will be granted
          early access beforehand, and if one of you is late... everyone must
          wait in the queue outside the venue until they arrive.{" "}

        <p className="text-white my-2">
          All tickets have now been dispatched and delivered to all successful
          applicants. Please note, having a ticket does NOT grant you access to
          the festival. As stated on the Event Details page, you will enter a
          series of queue checkpoints before you can enter the venue â€“ failure
          to complete a checkpoint, failure to enter. The ticket you have
          received in the post MUST be brought with you on the day of the event.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white my-2">
          The ticket in your bundle must be brought to the event on the day.

          Once you have successfully entered the festival, your ticket will
          grant you access to a lovely outdoor toilet, seating areas and a bar.
          Drinks can be purchased on sight, however our prices have increased
          since last year due to inflation (i.e. recuperating back spends on
          this year's event). A SMALL selection of food will be available on the
          day, but please feel free to bring your own dishes to share amongst
          others if you feel so inclined.
